## About Me

I am Lorraine Yuan, a fifth-year PhD candidate in the [Operations, Technology, and Information Management (OTIM)](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/operations-technology-information-management/) division of SC Johnson College of Business at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Karan Girotra](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/karan-girotra/) and [Prof. Elena Belavina](https://sha.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eb733/). I’m also a doctoral fellow at the [Digital Life Initiative](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/). I obtained a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from Renmin University of China. I also hold a M.Eng. in Operations Research from Cornell Tech.

My research methodology combines data-driven optimization, machine learning techniques, network theory, and differential privacy algorithms.
